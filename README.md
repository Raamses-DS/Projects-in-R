All the content required for the construction of the result is found on the Coursera platform.

## All the Files

# CodeBook.md 
Describes how all the transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

# dataanalysis.R
Contains all the code to perform the analyses described in 5 steps.

Here are the five steps:

1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# tidySet.txt 
Is the output data of the final step.
